## Rewrite of the NICERC Physics Curriculum to use the Raspberry Pi device

This is a rewrite of the existing Student Materials for the [NICERC Physics Curriculum](https://nicerc.org/) to make use of the Raspberry Pi devices. Hopefully this will be useful for anyone wishing to use the NICERC Computer Science Curriculum (which uses the Raspberry Pi platform) along with the Physics Curriculum. All materials are being written in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

### Materials needed

* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* [Pimoroni Explorer Pro HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer-hat)
* [STS-PI Robot Chassis](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/sts-pi)
* [MPU6050 Gyro/Accelerometer](https://www.amazon.com/MPU-6050-MPU6050-Accelerometer-Gyroscope-Converter/dp/B008BOPN40/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1530192890&sr=8-2&keywords=MPU6050)
