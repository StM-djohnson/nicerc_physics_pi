    "#### Building Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with circuits on a breadboard, there are several different parts that all serve a specific purpose, including the breadboard itself. Let’s look at the parts listed below to gain insight on building circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Voltage Source\n",
    "* Ground\n",
    "* Breadboard\n",
    "* Switches\n",
    "* Conductors\n",
    "* LEDs\n",
    "* Resistors\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Voltage Source_**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **_voltage source_** is the component of a circuit that provides electrical energy. In the circuits we will be building, this will be supplied via the power connected to the Raspberry Pi. We will access the voltage source through the pins on the Explorer HAT Pro labeled either 5V (2 pins available) or 3.3V. These pins provide a regulated voltage of 5V or 3.3V. \n",
    "![voltage](../images/02.01.voltage.png)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Voltage pins are marked by red circles. Notice two 5V pins and one 3.3V pin.*</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Ground_**\n",
    "\n",
    "All components in a circuit must connect from the positive end to the negative end. If we think of the positive end of a voltage source as the beginning of a circuit, then ground can be thought of as the end. On the Explorer HAT Pro, the pins labeled GND indicate ground and complete the circuit. Thus, 5V/3.3V can be thought of as the positive end of the battery, and GND as the negative end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Breadboard_**\n",
    "\n",
    "A breadboard, or prototyping board (proto board for short), is use to connect different pieces of a circuit more easily. On an Explorer HAT Pro breadboard, oriented as pictured in Figure 2, the horizontally adjacent pins are connected to each other unless there is a gap between them. The vertically adjacent pins are not connected.\n",
    "![breadboard](../images/02.01.breadboard.png)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*All pins with a red line through them are connected. Pins across the gap **are not** connected.*</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine if the circuit components are connected in each diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![exercise](../images/02.01.exercise.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Switches_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Switches are used to control the flow of electricity. If the switch is close, in the “on” state, electricity flows. If the switch is open, in the “off” state, electricity will not flow. The type of switch used in this lesson is called a tact, or tactile, switch. The tact switch below has four prongs and a push button. One way to control a circuit with this switch is by connecting the tact switch to the circuit through diagonally opposite corners.\n",
    "![switch](../images/02.01.switch.png)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*The tact switch shown above on the left has four prongs, <br/>two on the left side and two on the right side. The diagram <br/>on the right shows the inner connections of the switch. The<br/> switch is open in the diagram.*</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Jumper Wire_**\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect one circuit component to another, you can use jumper wire. Jumper wire is wire that allows the flow of electricity. In other words, it is conductive wire. Although jumper wire comes in many different colors, the color of the rubbery coating has no effect on its conductivity. Thus, the color of the jumper wire does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_LEDs_**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **_LED_** or light emitting diode is a semiconductor light source. LEDs have two leads, an anode lead and a cathode lead. Note that **_LEDs are one directional_**. The anode lead is typically longer and should always be nearer to 5V/3.3V than the cathode lead. The cathode lead is typically shorter and on the side of the LED with the flat rim or notch. The cathode lead should be on the side of the LED that is closer to ground, or GND.\n",
    "![led](../images/02.01.led.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Resistors_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Resistors slow the flow of current by adding resistance, measured in ohms, to a circuit. Without resistors, it is very easy to fry an LED. As the figure below shows, resistors have two leads and color bands. The color bands indicate the amount of resistance provided by that resistor. To determine the resistance, we can use the chart below. Each color represents a number value and each band gives those numbers meaning.\n",
    "![resistor chart](../images/02.01.resistor.chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the following process to determine the value of the resistor above. Note that this process only uses the first three color bands. The gold/silver band is a manufacturers tolerance which is of no concern for this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. First find a two digit number using the first two color bands. Since the first color band (furthest to the left) of the resistor is red, the left digit will be 2. Since the second color band is identical, the second digit will be the same number. Thus our two digit number is 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. To find the multiplier, you must find the value of $10^{thirdbandcolor}$ or $10^{brown}$. The multiplier will scale the two digit number found in step one to get the value of resistance in ohms. Since $10^{brown}$ represents $10^{1}$, multiply 22 by $10^{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Thus, after multiplication of $22 * 10^{1}$ you see the resistor is 220 Ohms, or 220$\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the resistance of the following resistors. The color names have been printed for convenience.\n",
    "![resistor_practice](../images/02.01.resistor.practice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circuit Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in teams, see if you can build a circuit on a breadboard that will control an LED by a tact switch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need to incorporate a resistor along with the LED to control the flow of current such that the resistor does not burn out.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the switch diagram to help you determine how the tact switch should be wired."
