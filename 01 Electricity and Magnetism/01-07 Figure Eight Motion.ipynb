    "\n",
    "Todayâ€™s class will be filled with two activities that use the concepts from last class on programming Raspberry Pi motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activity 1: Motion Around a Pencil\n",
    "\n",
    "The first activity will require your Raspberry Pi to perform a simple forward and turning motion. Try to make your Raspberry Pi move around a pencil and return to its starting location. This project should be done in teams of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup: Clear everything from your table except a Raspberry Pi and a computer for each team of students. Place two books or notebooks on the table 11 inches apart (the length of a standard sheet of paper) near one edge of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Program your Raspberry Pi to leave from a starting point between the notebooks and around the pencil. Return to the area between or behind the notebooks and stop before running off the table. Use the `explorerhat` library commands for the various moves (forwards, backwards, using individual motors, etc.). Create a flow chart of the motion needed for the Raspberry Pi to complete the task. Have your instructor check to see that your program is working before leaving class.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Activity 2: Figure Eight\n",
    "\n",
    "The second activity will require your Raspberry Pi to perform a figure 8 motion around two objects set a certain distance apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup: Take two objects (cups, books, keys, etc.) and place them approximately 22 inches apart (length of two sheets of paper). This will form the figure 8 course the Raspberry Pi will follow. Start the Raspberry Pi near one of the objects as indicated in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Make a flow chart of the program needed to form the figure 8 prior to writing the program. Write a program that allows the Raspberry Pi to form a figure 8 around the objects and return to the starting location.\n",
