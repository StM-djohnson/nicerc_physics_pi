    "Each RasPi has an unique IP address associated with it. This is a (long) number that serves as an address on the network - much like your home address. The IP address is assigned to your device and will not change as long as you are connected to the school's wireless network. Consult your class documentation to get your IP address (it looks like: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)\n",
