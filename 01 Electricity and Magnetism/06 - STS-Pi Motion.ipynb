    "### 06 STS-Pi Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you are going to make your Raspberry Pi move. Before you program the Raspberry Pi to move, you need to understand some of the mechanics behind the Raspberry Pi motion.\n",
    "First, let’s look at the motors. A basic picture of the motor is shown below illustrating the external components of the motor.\n",
    "As shown in the diagram, there are two wires that connect the motor to the main electronics board of the Raspberry Pi. The Explorer Pro HAT has 2 motor connections, and the STS-Pi motor has 2 connections wired into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/01.06.motor.JPG\" alt=\"drawing\" align=\"left\" width=\"300px\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/01.06.motor.top.JPG\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain two male/female jumper cables. Place two male jumper cables into the Explorer Pro HAT MOTOR 1 section. For now placement in the + or - does not matter. Now connect the female part of the cables onto the motor pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/01.06.explorer.connect.JPG\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main components that make up the internal workings of the motor are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* small DC motor\n",
    "* gear box with small plastic gears to reduce the RPM and increase output torque\n",
    "* special electronics inside the motor that interpret a pulse signal and deliver power to the motor\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, let’s focus more on the third component in the servos: the electronics. In later lessons, more detail will be given about the DC motor and the gear box.\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the servo (motor) contains special electronics that interpret a pulse signal and deliver power to the motor. There are two types of servos:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standard servo: the pulse signal tells the servo what position to hold.\n",
    "2. Continuous servo: interprets the pulse signal to spin a certain direction and the speed at which to spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard servo is useful for positioning an object, but has very limited rotational motion. Thus, we will use a continuous servo.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very simple to control the motors using the Explorer Pro python library. Full documentation for the library is [available on their Github.](https://github.com/pimoroni/explorer-hat/blob/master/documentation/Function-reference.md) For now we are going to import the library (it has already been installed on your Raspberry Pi), and send a command to turn both wheels for 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remotely connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH and create a directory `06.STS-Pi_Motion`. Move inside that directory and create a file: `nano -w 06.motors.py`. Edit the file to contain these lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import explorerhat\n",
    "from time import sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    explorerhat.motor.forwards()\n",
    "    sleep(2)\n",
    "    explorerhat.motor.stop()\n",
    "    sleep(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To end the program, simply press Ctrl + C to break the command. If either of the motors were moving in the 'wrong' (not forward) direction, simply flip the + and - jumpers on the Explorer Pro HAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did quite a few things in that little program. Let's take a look at a few of the lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `import explorerhat` - this makes available all the functions in the 'explorerhat' library to our program. Python is very extendable  through libraries, which you can load as needed. \n",
    "* `from time import sleep` - instead of importing the entire `time` library, we have opted to simply import only the `sleep` function. In large programs this saves memory and resources.\n",
    "* `while True` - this is a `while` loop, which does whatever is contained in the loop as long as the condition is met - in this case our condition is `True`, which means the while loop always runs.\n",
    "* `explorerhat.motor.forwards()`, `explorerhat.motor.stop()` - these are commands from the `explorerhat` library, and explain themselves. .forwards() makes both motors go, .stop() makes them both stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important things to note is that `explorerhat.motor.forwards()` needs to be called continuously in order to keep the motors moving. In this case we turned the motors on for 2 seconds, we called the forwards() command then `sleep(2)` to wait for 2 seconds while `..forwards()` runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `explorerhat` library, each motor can be addressed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `explorerhat.motor.one`\n",
    "* `explorerhat.motor.two`\n",
    "\n",
    "Not referencing a motor makes both motors move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try writing the same script as above, but have it turn motor one for 2 seconds then motor 2 for 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import explorerhat\n",
    "from time import sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    explorerhat.motor.one.forwards()\n",
    "    sleep(2)\n",
    "    explorerhat.motor.one.stop()\n",
    "    explorerhat.motor.two.forwards()\n",
    "    sleep(2)\n",
    "    explorerhat.motor.two.stop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! We can do two more advanced things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `explorerhat.motor.backwards()` - this will make the motor(s) run in reverse.\n",
    "* `explorerhat.motor.forwards(x)`, `explorerhat.motor.backwards(x)` - the motors will run at a speed = x, where x is from 0 to 100.\n",
    "* `explorerhat.motor.speed(x)` - sets the speed of a running motor to x, where x is from 0 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out and edit our file to run the motors at different speeds."
