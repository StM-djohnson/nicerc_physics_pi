    "Remember the countdown from last class? What if you want to change the delay between each number? We used the `time.sleep(2)` command to slow down each output line by 2 seconds. But what if we didn't want to use 2 seconds? What if we wanted to change that delay to a different number? One thing we can do is declare a variable to be equal to our delay amount. \n",

    "Think of a variable in mathematics. You can have an equation like, y = mx + b, where m and b are constants (the slope and y‐intercept, respectively), but the y and x are variables that can change values. The same idea is used here in programming. You can assign a variable name to a changing component in a program, and then define how you want that variable to change.\n",

    "You may have noticed in the Countdown program we used a FOR loop `for x in reversed(range(1, 11))`. Let's take a closer look at this. Python does not use a 'countdown for loop' like many other programming languages do. Instead, in Python we can devise a `range` of numbers to run over. Because we were counting *down*, we used the `reversed` function to flip the range. Let's try to rewrite the program using a variable countdown length. Here's the original program:\n",
