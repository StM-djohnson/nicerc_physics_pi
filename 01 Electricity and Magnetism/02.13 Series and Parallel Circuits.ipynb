    "Circuit elements that are in series share the same current. There is no other path in which current can flow except that path between and through the elements that are in series. Another way to think of elements in series is that only one end of each element is connected together.\n",

    "Circuit elements that are in parallel share the same voltage. The voltage across any one of the elements in parallel is the same as the voltage across all of the elements in parallel. Another way to think of elements in parallel is that both ends of each element are connected together.\n",
