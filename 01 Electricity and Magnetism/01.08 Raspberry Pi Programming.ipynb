    "An excellent exercise is to make the Raspberry Pi move at different speeds instead of a constant speed. In order to make the Raspberry Pi gradually speed up from a standstill to its maximum velocity, hold that speed for a fixed time period, and then slow back down to a standstill, one method is to use changing variables inside of while loops. Let's look at the following snippit of code."

    "Let's take a closer look at this code. Most of it should be familiar, so let's jump down to line 4. We initialize a variable named `motor_speed` to be zero. On line 7 we nest another `while` loop inside our first `while` - and this loop has a condition: run as long as our variable is less than or equal to 100. Line 8 sets the motor speed to our variable. Line 9 sleeps for .1 of a second. Line 10 *increases* our variable by 10, and the loop starts again.\n",

    "Another interesting exercise is to program the Raspberry Pi to navigate in a figure 8 pattern. This is a variation of programming the Raspberry Pi to navigate in a circle. A figure 8 can be navigated using two circles, clockwise followed by counterclockwise (or vice versa). This same pattern can also be navigated by following one semi-circle, followed by a full circle, followed by another semi-circle. Navigate this pattern\n",
