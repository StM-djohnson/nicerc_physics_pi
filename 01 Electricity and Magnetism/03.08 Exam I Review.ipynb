    "#### Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microcontroller** – A small computer on a single integrated circuit that can be programmed to read sensors, make decisions, and orchestrate devices that control moving parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flowchart** – Graphical representation of a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schematic Diagram** – Graphical representation of an electronic circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LED** – Light Emitting Diode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Load** – Something that uses energy (in a circuit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source** – Something that supplies energy (in a circuit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Charge** – A measure of electrostatic force; can be either positive (+) or negative (‐).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circuit** – A closed path that allows charge to flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Electricity** – The movement of charge (usually electrons).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conductor** – Material through which electrons travel easily. They contain a large number of free electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insulator** – Material through which electrons travel poorly or not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semiconductor** – Material that can act like a conductor or an insulator depending on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Voltage (V)** – An electromotive force (emf), analogous to pressure, that drives the flow of charge. The work done in moving a charge from point A to point B in an electrical circuit, measured in joules (J), divided by the charge, measured in coulombs (C):\n",
    "$$ 1V = \\frac{1J}{1C} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Joule** ‐ A unit of energy (SI system) equal to:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1kg \\cdot m^2}{s^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coulomb** – A quantity of charge equal to 6.24 x 1018 electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current (i)** – The quantity of electrons passing a given point in a given time. Measured in coulombs per second. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1 coulomb}{1 second} = 1 amperes (A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resistance (r)** – Frictional losses that occur when electrons flow through a material. The property of a material that describes how easily charge may pass through it. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$1\\Omega = \\frac{1V}{1A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Photoresistor** – A resistor whose resistance varies with exposure to light.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potentiometer** – Variable resistor that effectively creates two resistors with a center “tap” (wiper), such that the values of the two resistors separated by the wiper always add up to the value of the potentiometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Resistor) Tolerance** – The amount (percentage) of possible variation from the specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analog Signal (Continuous)** – Signals (e.g., voltage, current) that are continuous in both time and value (magnitude).\n",
